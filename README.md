This repository demonstrates a runtime type error in TypeScript.  The `printNumber` function is defined to accept a number, but the code attempts to pass a string.  The TypeScript compiler won't catch this because type checking primarily focuses on compile-time errors. This highlights the importance of robust runtime checks, especially when dealing with external data sources or user input. The solution demonstrates how to add runtime type checking to prevent the error.
